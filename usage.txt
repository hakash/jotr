Use jotr to "jot down" tagged notes (a jot). Default launches a terminal editor. Use Ctrl+D to save, Ctrl+C to exit without saving.

If no tags are given, the jot will be tagged with "Random".

If you don't want to use the built-in editor you can use the flag '-c' to add your jot directly in the command line. Use '--' to mark the end of the jot if you need to palce more flags or arguments behind it. Otherwise it runs to the end.

Use '-g' to search the jots for a specific term.

Use '-l' to print the jots to the terminal. Supply tags to print jots with specific tags. Also here, use '--' to mark the end of your list if you need to end it before the end of the terminal input.

Use '--export' to export the data to a given filename. Supports JSON and YAML based on the file extension.

Usage: 
  $0 [tags] [-c one-liner jot] [--debug]
  $0 -g <term> [--debug]
  $0 -l [tags] [--debug]
